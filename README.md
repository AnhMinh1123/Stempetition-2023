# TechCare Project - FPT STEMPetition Da Nang 2023

Intro

Fschools STEMPetition 2023 was an annual science and technology competition for FPT Schools students nationwide, themed "Innovations change the world." It aimed to ignite curiosity, inspire STEM exploration, and foster self-learning skills. The competition featured Scientific Research and Engineering Technology categories, where teams presented ideas via research-standard posters. TechCare was honored to reach the National Finals in Da Nang, a valuable experience for learning and competing with other talented STEM students.

**TechCare** is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered project in the healthcare domain, developed with the vision of alleviating the burden on hospitals and medical facilities, particularly in the context of staff shortages and increasing patient overload.

**The Problem We Address:**
Current healthcare systems frequently face overwhelming demands, especially in emergency rooms and general outpatient clinics, where numerous minor or non-critical cases consume a significant amount of resources and medical staff time. This not only strains healthcare professionals but also prolongs patient waiting times, impacting the quality of service.

**TechCare's Core Idea and Solution:**
TechCare offers an initial screening and preliminary diagnosis solution for mild, non-severely dangerous illnesses, based on the analysis of subtle patient symptoms and manifestations. Instead of needing to visit a hospital for every health concern, users can utilize TechCare to receive an initial assessment and timely advice.

**How TechCare Works:**
TechCare leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning to analyze user-input data (such as described symptoms). The system is trained on a large dataset to be capable of:
* **Initial Screening:** Assessing the severity of symptoms and determining if an immediate doctor's visit is necessary.
* **Preliminary Diagnosis:** Suggesting potential illnesses for mild cases, providing useful information for users to be more proactive in their self-care.

**Technologies and Libraries Used:**
TechCare is built upon the following foundation:
* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Machine Learning Model:** LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) - an efficient and powerful machine learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks.
* **Data Processing Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Data Visualization Library:** Seaborn (used during the analysis and model development process)
* **Machine Learning Library:** Scikit-learn (Sklearn)
* **Model Persistence:** Pickle (for saving and loading the trained machine learning model)

**Key Features:**
* AI system processes and analyzes data to provide screening results.
* Offers preliminary diagnoses for mild conditions based on provided characteristics.

TechCare does not aim to completely replace the role of medical professionals but serves as a powerful assistive tool, helping to ease the burden on the healthcare system and empowering individuals to manage their personal health more actively and efficiently.
